# In-App Voice & Video Calls

Voice and video calling have been removed from this app. The chat screen no longer shows call buttons, and there are no incoming call notifications or in-call UI.

To restore calling in the future, you would need to re-add a calling SDK (e.g. Twilio Video), the call invite flow, and the Supabase Edge Function for tokens.
